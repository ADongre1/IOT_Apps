IoT Apps for Catawba County, NC - written by Arjun Dongre

Web applications developed using ESRI ArcGIS for Javascript API, dojo Toolkit, ArcServer hosted Routing Service, and NodeJS, and and SOI developed in ArcObjects for Java SDK

### EMS Live Dispatch

This application is part of a broader toolkit created in the ESRI stack. The EMS Dispatch uses the ArcGIS for JS API in conjunction with a Node Websocket (SocketIO/Express) to stream real-time EMS Vehicle location information. Any combination of vehicles can be queried from a selection list. The nearest available vehicle can be routed by searching for an address, or a street intersection. Historic GPS data can also be viewed on the map, as well as tabular entries in a dGrid based table. Hovering over entries in the table will highlight the point yellow, converely hovering over a point will bring the table entry into view and make it bold. One can also find the drive time between two points using a route query tool. The NodeJS websocket streams the location as well as car status and incident information to the client. The incidents are also geocoded and displayed using a custom geocoding service. The entire application is secured by triangulating the unique token generated by ArcServer security protocols between the Node server, the client and ArcServer.

### Meals on Wheels Turn by Turn Voice Navigation

This application leverages the browsers voice synthesis api and client location information residing in an ArcServer Service, and a ArcServer Network Analysis Routing Service. The mobile_nav.js module is where the heavy routing processing takes place. There two major steps for the app to work on the back end, geolocating the clients which happens on the back-end every night, a custom nightly build of the network dataset which combines additional centerline driveway info for routing apartment and townhome complexes. The user geolocation goes through a different geolocation path depending on if they fall in one of these parcels or not. This app took about 2.5 years total between my other projects, and went through several iterations to get right.
